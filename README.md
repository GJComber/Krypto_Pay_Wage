# Krypto_Pay_Wage

 This project is building a platform called KryptoJobs2Go. It is an application that customers can use to choose fintech professionals from a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them in Ethereum. The app integrates the Ethereum blockchain network into its funcionality in order to instantly pay the fintech professionals with cryptocurrency.

The KryptoJobs2Go application uses Streamlit for the UI, Ganache for Ethereum transactions and the Python codes are run within Remix. One code is predominantly functions the other is the product database and UI 


The Application in action.

* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.

* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

To demonstrate how a customer can choose a Fintech professional and pay them as well as demonstrate that the payment was actually made, I have the following images to review.

*  Compare the candidate profiles then select hiree from list on the sidebar, enter time required and click Send Transaction. Note: Balloons float up to indicate transaction success.
